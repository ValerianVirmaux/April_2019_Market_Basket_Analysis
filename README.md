Market Basket Analysis

PROJECT GOAL

To help a fictious board of directors form a clearer picture of the customer-buying patterns of an online competitor they are considering acquiring. If the recommendation is to buy the competitor, make suggestions relating to, for example, cross-selling and promotions based on the findings from the market basket analysis.

SUPPLIED DATA

A CSV file containing one month's data of the competitor's online transactions as well as a file containing their product offering.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

Language used: R

Read transactional data

Compare product portfolios of Blackwell's (the client) and Electronidex (the competitor).

Investigate the transaction records to see if there are any patterns or immediate insights such as the most frequently bought items and number of items purchased. Compare this information with what we know about Blackwell's to see any similarities or complementary characteristics between the portfolios of the two companies.

Use Apriori algorithms to uncover insights relating to the transactional dataset based on items' frequency. This information could be used as the basis of cross-selling campaigns or inform the role of loss-leaders.
